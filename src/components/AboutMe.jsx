          Hi, I'm Vicky Brooke. I am seeking a new challenge after working in
          the education sector for 16 years, including the last 10 years as a
          primary teacher. Having started a family I made the decision to switch
          careers. I have always been intrigued by technology and felt like this
          was the perfect time to challenge myself and pursue my interest in
          coding.
        </p>
        <h2>Northcoders</h2>
        <p>
          I enrolled in the Northcoders bootcamp in January 2022. Following a
          brief break due to COVID I graduated in May and am keen to build on my
          knowledge and develop my skills within the industry.
